# Encrypted Biometric Similarity System (OpenFHE CKKS)

**Privacy-preserving maximum cosine similarity computation over encrypted 512-dimensional vectors using threshold homomorphic encryption.**

This system demonstrates a complete solution for computing the maximum cosine similarity across an encrypted database without ever decrypting individual vectors. Only the final maximum similarity value and threshold decision are revealed through secure threshold decryption.


## Architecture

### Privacy Model

- **Threshold Decryption**: t-of-n multiparty scheme (default: 2-of-3)
- **No Full Secret Key**: Server only holds public and evaluation keys
- **Secure Computation**: All similarity computations performed homomorphically
- **Minimal Leakage**: Only final maximum similarity and threshold decision revealed
- **Polynomial Degree**: Use degree-7 Chebyshev approximation (configurable to 9/11)

### Core Components

1. **Vector Packing**: Multiple 512-D vectors per ciphertext for efficiency
2. **Encrypted Cosine Similarity**: Packed dot product computation
3. **Encrypted Maximum**: Tournament-style reduction with polynomial comparators
4. **Threshold Decision**: Encrypted comparison against configurable threshold Ï„

### System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10/11 (tested with MSYS2 MinGW)
- **Compiler**: C++17 compatible (GCC 9+ recommended)
